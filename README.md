# The-Install-Package-Utility-official-repository
The official repository for the TUI utility to make installing APT packages easier!
Please make sure you have installed "fzf" through the terminal (sudo apt install fzf) or trying to search would reply (for a split second) "/usr/local/bin: ipkg.sh : fzf: command not found"
And also, please make sure you moved the utility to /usr/local/bin and ran in the terminal "sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ipkg.sh" so it works everywhere by running "ipkg.sh"
and finally, to download, click on the green "Code" button, then copy the link there, and go to the terminal and run "git clone [url from the Code button]"
